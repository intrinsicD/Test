# Automation Scripts

## Current State

- Provides entry points for local developer workflows and CI orchestration.
- Currently outlines the script categories without concrete implementations in place.

## Usage

- Run scripts from the repository root to maintain consistent relative paths.
- Reflect any workflow changes across CI and local scripts to avoid divergence.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Consolidate automation entry points for developers and CI environments.
