# Design Documents

The `docs/design/` directory stores higher-level architectural proposals, diagrams, and exploratory notes that guide the
engine roadmap.

## Current Assets

- [Engine Architecture Overview](architecture.md) â€” Module boundaries, ECS layering, and runtime discovery.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Keep diagrams and figures co-located with their editable source formats.
- Cross-reference engine headers or source files when describing behaviour.
- Update the document history or changelog section (when present) so readers can track revisions.
