# API Documentation

## Current State

- Collects subsystem API summaries and call sequences for the runtime and tooling layers.
- Provides per-module Markdown files that mirror the exported headers.

## Usage

- Update the relevant API note whenever a public header changes.
- Keep diagrams or tables close to the code they describe to minimise drift.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Document subsystem APIs and keep diagrams in sync with code changes.
