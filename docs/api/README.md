# API Reference Index

The `docs/api/` directory catalogues focused references for each engine subsystem that exposes a public interface.

## Current Topics

- [Animation Module](animation.md) — Clip management, controllers, and rig pose evaluation.
- [Compute Module](compute.md) — Kernel dispatch graphs and execution reports.
- [Geometry Module](geometry.md) — Shape primitives, spatial queries, and property registries.
- [Physics Module](physics.md) — Lightweight rigid-body integration helpers.
- [Runtime Module](runtime.md) — Simulation orchestration and shared C bindings.
- [Math Module](math.md) — Foundational numeric types and utility routines.
- [Scene Module](scene.md) — Entity-component façade wrapping `entt`.

## Authoring Notes

- Mirror the namespace hierarchy used in `engine/` headers when introducing new API documents.
- Include short code snippets or tables to demonstrate typical usage patterns.
- Keep tables of contents up to date so navigation across longer documents remains easy.
