# Documentation Hub

The `docs/` subtree aggregates written documentation for the engine project.

## Structure
- `api/` – High-level API references and module descriptions.
- `design/` – Architectural sketches, diagrams, and exploratory design documents.

Each nested directory provides its own README for finer-grained navigation.
