# Documentation Hub

## Current State

- Central index that links design notes, API references, and validation utilities.
- Serves as the landing page for contributors seeking written guidance about the engine.

## Usage

- Use this entry point to navigate to API and design subdirectories before changing the code.
- Reference `docs/README_TEMPLATE.md` when drafting or updating module READMEs.
- Consult topical roadmaps (for example, [roadmaps/physics.md](roadmaps/physics.md)) to understand active planning before modifying subsystems.
- Review the consolidated [global roadmap](global_roadmap.md) when planning cross-module work so priorities stay synchronised.
- Run `python scripts/validate_docs.py` to keep cross-references intact after edits.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Expand living design documents with current architectural decisions.
