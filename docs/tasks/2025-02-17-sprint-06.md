# 2025-02-17: Sprint 06 Alignment

## Goal
Deliver the runtime ↔ rendering vertical slice by expanding frame-graph metadata (`AI-003`) and wiring the Vulkan prototype (`RT-003`) through `RuntimeHost`.

## Streams
- **Frame-Graph Metadata:** Extend resource descriptors, queue affinity, and validation hooks per [`docs/specs/ADR-0003-runtime-frame-graph.md`](../specs/ADR-0003-runtime-frame-graph.md).
- **Runtime Integration:** Expose scheduler hooks in `engine/runtime` and mirror frame-graph outputs into the rendering backend adapter.
- **Diagnostics:** Instrument telemetry for animation/physics ↔ rendering handoff. Capture timings in `scripts/` for regression tracking.

## Dependencies
- `DC-001` – subsystem interfaces and plugin discovery must be in place.
- `AI-001` – resource lifetime management ensures shared handles remain valid across runtime/rendering boundaries.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Updated frame-graph metadata structures with deterministic serialisation.
- [ ] Vulkan backend prototype submits at least one test pass via the runtime entrypoint.
- [ ] Documentation updated in [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md) and module READMEs.
- [ ] Telemetry script committed under `scripts/diagnostics/` with README instructions.

## Notes
- Coordinate with `docs/modules/rendering/ROADMAP.md` for milestone sequencing.
- Capture perf baselines in this file after the first successful end-to-end run.
