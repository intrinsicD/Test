# Tools Module Roadmap

## Near Term
- Define build targets and scaffolding for command-line asset pipeline utilities; document expected inputs/outputs.
- Stand up a Dear ImGui-based diagnostics shell that consumes runtime telemetry and hot-reload hooks.

## Mid Term
- Integrate profiling capture/export workflows and create viewers for CPU/GPU traces.
- Prototype an editor shell with dockable panels, scene graph inspection, and asset browsers.

## Long Term
- Package tooling for distribution (configuration management, installers) and integrate automated testing to keep workflows reliable across platforms.
