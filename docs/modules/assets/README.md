# Assets Module

## Current State
- Exposes generational `ResourceHandle<Tag>` wrappers for meshes, graphs, point clouds, textures, shaders, and materials. Handles retain their identifier but bind lazily to a `ResourcePool`, preventing stale references after unloads.
- Backs every cache with `engine::core::memory::ResourcePool`, a free-list allocator that increments generation counters when slots are recycled. The caches maintain identifier â†” handle maps and stage hot-reload callbacks until the first load occurs.
- Provides caches for meshes, point clouds, graphs, textures, and shaders that track descriptors, last-write timestamps, and hot-reload callbacks while delegating format-aware loading to `engine::io` utilities. Mesh and point cloud caches expose `load_async()` entry points backed by `AssetAsyncQueue`, scheduling non-blocking imports on the shared IO thread pool.
- Defines asset descriptors that capture provenance, format hints, and binding metadata shared between caches and runtime consumers.
- Stores material assets as descriptor bindings (shader + texture handles); material authoring, serialization, and hot-reload remain TODO.
- Unit tests under `engine/assets/tests/` validate module registration, cache
  reload behaviour, descriptor plumbing, generational handle semantics, and
  unload invalidation. Runtime-level verification of mesh cache loading feeds
  into the integration suite at [`engine/tests/integration`](../../../engine/tests/integration/README.md)
  (`TI-001`), which is currently blocked until the Googletest fork supports fixtures (`T-0118`).

## Usage
- Build the target with `cmake --build --preset <preset> --target engine_assets`; this links against `engine_io` and transitively pulls in geometry readers.
- Include `<engine/assets/handles.hpp>` plus the relevant cache headers (`mesh_asset.hpp`, `point_cloud_asset.hpp`, `graph_asset.hpp`, `texture_asset.hpp`, `shader_asset.hpp`) to request loads; configure `engine_io` importers for the formats you rely on. For asynchronous scenarios include `<engine/assets/async.hpp>` and call `load_async()` to obtain an `AssetLoadFuture`.
- Populate `MaterialCache` entries by constructing descriptors that bind preloaded shader/texture handles until material serialization lands.
- Execute `ctest --preset <preset> --tests-regex engine_assets` with testing enabled to validate cache behaviour after modifications.
- Use `<engine/assets/async.hpp>` to construct `AssetLoadRequest` descriptors and pair them with `AssetLoadFuture`/`AssetLoadPromise` channels when scheduling asynchronous work. Futures expose progress, cancellation, and structured error propagation while preserving the generational handle guarantees from `AI-001`. `scripts/diagnostics/streaming_report.py` queries `engine::runtime::streaming_metrics()` to monitor queue depth and request outcomes.

## Roadmap
- See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for upcoming work and the asynchronous streaming
  design captured in [`docs/design/async_streaming.md`](../../design/async_streaming.md).
