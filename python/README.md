# Python Tooling

## Current State

- Provides the root for Python-based automation, testing, and runtime bindings.
- Relies on the native modules to be discoverable via environment configuration.

## Usage

- Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies once `requirements.txt` is defined.
- Execute `pytest` after building native modules to validate the Python side.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Publish the Python packaging and dependency manifest for automation helpers.
