# Engine Io Sources

## Current State

- Implements the module logic across Api, Geometry Io, Geometry Io Registry.

## Usage

- Source files compile into `engine_io`; ensure the build target stays warning-clean.
- Mirror API additions with implementation updates in this directory.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Add scenario-driven examples and profiling to exercise the implementation.
