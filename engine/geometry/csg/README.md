# engine/geometry/csg

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the geometry subsystem for meshes, primitives, and spatial algorithms, constructive solid geometry operations.
Future additions should place additional contributions to constructive solid geometry operations here to keep related work easy to discover.
