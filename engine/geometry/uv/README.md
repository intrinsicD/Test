# engine/geometry/uv

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the geometry subsystem for meshes, primitives, and spatial algorithms, UV unwrapping and parameterisation tooling.
Future additions should place additional contributions to UV unwrapping and parameterisation tooling here to keep related work easy to discover.
