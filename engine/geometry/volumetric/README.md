# engine/geometry/volumetric

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the geometry subsystem for meshes, primitives, and spatial algorithms, volumetric data structures and algorithms.
Future additions should place additional contributions to volumetric data structures and algorithms here to keep related work easy to discover.
