# engine/geometry/src/shapes

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the geometry subsystem for meshes, primitives, and spatial algorithms, C++ implementation files, geometric primitive definitions.
Future additions should place additional contributions to geometric primitive definitions here to keep related work easy to discover.
