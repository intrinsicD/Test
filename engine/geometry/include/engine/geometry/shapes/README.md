# engine/geometry/include/engine/geometry/shapes

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the geometry subsystem for meshes, primitives, and spatial algorithms, the public include namespace shapes, public headers defining the subsystem API.
Future additions should place additional contributions to public headers defining the subsystem API here to keep related work easy to discover.
