# engine/geometry/tests

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the geometry subsystem for meshes, primitives, and spatial algorithms, automated tests validating this layer.
It now includes coverage for the property registry to guarantee optional-based lookup semantics, default value propagation, and removal bookkeeping.
Future additions should place additional contributions to automated tests validating this layer here to keep related work easy to discover.
