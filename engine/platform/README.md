# Platform Module

## Current State

- Defines abstractions for filesystem access, input, windowing, and platform-specific utilities.
- Currently stubs out real OS integration pending backend work.

## Usage

- Link against `engine_platform` when consuming platform services from other modules.
- Implement platform-specific backends in the dedicated subdirectories as requirements mature.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Bind platform abstractions to OS windowing, input, and filesystem APIs.
