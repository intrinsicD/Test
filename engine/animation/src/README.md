# Engine Animation Sources

## Current State

- Implements the module logic across API and serialization helpers.

## Usage

- Source files compile into `engine_animation`; ensure the build target stays warning-clean.
- Mirror API additions with implementation updates in this directory.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Add scenario-driven examples and profiling to exercise the implementation.
