# Runtime Module

## Current State

- Provides the aggregation layer that will stitch subsystems into an executable runtime.
- Includes scaffolding for lifecycle management and module loading.

## Usage

- Link against `engine_runtime` to bootstrap the engine once subsystems are wired together.
- Expand runtime orchestration logic under `src/` and keep tests aligned with subsystem growth.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Drive subsystem lifecycles and state management for end-to-end scenarios.
