# engine/compute/cuda/src

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the general compute subsystem, including CPU and GPU acceleration paths, CUDA-specific compute paths, C++ implementation files.
Future additions should place additional contributions to C++ implementation files here to keep related work easy to discover.
