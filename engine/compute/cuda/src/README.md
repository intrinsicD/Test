# Engine Compute CUDA Sources

## Current State

- Implements the module logic across Api.

## Usage

- Source files compile into `engine_compute`; ensure the build target stays warning-clean.
- Mirror API additions with implementation updates in this directory.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Integrate CUDA kernels and scheduling into the dispatcher.
