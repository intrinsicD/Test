# engine/compute/cuda

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the general compute subsystem, including CPU and GPU acceleration paths, CUDA-specific compute paths.
Future additions should place additional contributions to CUDA-specific compute paths here to keep related work easy to discover.
