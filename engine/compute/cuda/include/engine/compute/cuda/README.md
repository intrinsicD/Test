# engine/compute/cuda/include/engine/compute/cuda

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the general compute subsystem, including CPU and GPU acceleration paths, the public include namespace cuda, CUDA-specific compute paths, public headers defining the subsystem API.
Future additions should place additional contributions to public headers defining the subsystem API here to keep related work easy to discover.
