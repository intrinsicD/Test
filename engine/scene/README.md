# Scene Module

## Current State

- Outlines the scene graph, component storage, serialization, and system execution layout.
- Currently focuses on structure and scaffolding pending concrete implementations.

## Usage

- Link against `engine_scene` to host world state once components and systems are implemented.
- Keep serialization and graph updates coordinated with runtime requirements.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Implement scene graph serialization, systems, and runtime traversal.
