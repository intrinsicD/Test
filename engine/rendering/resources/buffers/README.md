# engine/rendering/resources/buffers

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the rendering subsystem covering GPU pipelines, shading, and visual resources, resource descriptions and supporting data, buffer definitions and helpers.
Future additions should place additional contributions to buffer definitions and helpers here to keep related work easy to discover.
