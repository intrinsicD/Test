# engine/rendering/resources/samplers

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the rendering subsystem covering GPU pipelines, shading, and visual resources, resource descriptions and supporting data, sampler definitions and presets.
Future additions should place additional contributions to sampler definitions and presets here to keep related work easy to discover.
