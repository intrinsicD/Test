# Engine Rendering Sources

## Current State

- Implements the module logic across Api, Forward Pipeline, Frame Graph, Material System.

## Usage

- Source files compile into `engine_rendering`; ensure the build target stays warning-clean.
- Mirror API additions with implementation updates in this directory.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Add scenario-driven examples and profiling to exercise the implementation.
