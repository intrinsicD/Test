# engine/rendering/materials/textures

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the rendering subsystem covering GPU pipelines, shading, and visual resources, material and shader authoring assets, texture processing utilities and references.
Future additions should place additional contributions to texture processing utilities and references here to keep related work easy to discover.
