# engine/rendering/include/engine/rendering

This directory collects the C++ engine source tree, the rendering subsystem covering GPU pipelines, shading, and visual resources, public headers defining the subsystem API.
Future additions should place additional contributions to public headers defining the subsystem API here to keep related work easy to discover.
