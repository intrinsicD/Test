# Tools Module

## Current State

- Houses editor, pipeline automation, and profiling utilities that sit atop the runtime.
- Presently acts as scaffolding for future tooling features.

## Usage

- Extend tooling subdirectories with standalone applications or scripts as capabilities evolve.
- Keep tooling build targets optional to avoid bloating the default configuration.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Stand up tooling flows for content pipelines, profiling, and editor workflows.
