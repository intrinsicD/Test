# Asset Module

## Current State

- Defines the staging area for runtime asset management across samples, shaders, and packaging.
- Currently focuses on directory scaffolding; concrete asset loaders remain to be implemented.

## Usage

- Organise engine-owned assets here so runtime modules can locate them consistently.
- Keep asset metadata in sync with runtime expectations while pipelines mature.

## TODO / Next Steps

- Design asset pipelines that feed runtime modules beyond sample data.
